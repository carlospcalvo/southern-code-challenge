# Southern Code React Challenge
## Requirements

### Using React, build an app that:
- [x] Connects to the NASA API (NASA Open APIs)
- [x] Obtains photos from the 'Mars Rover' endpoint
- [x] Allows the user to see the photos of each rover (Curiosity, Opportunity and Spirit)
- [x] The photos list should be paginated showing a max of 25 photos per page (dynamic loading similar to facebook/instagram will be nice, but not required)
- [x] Allows the user to filter the rover photos by camera
- [x] By default it shows the latest photos for current day
- [x] Allows the user to search for photos based on 'Earth Day' date (2020-09-22)
- [x] Allows the user to search for photos based on the 'Sol' date (2890)

### Optional:
- [ ] Let the user store search parameters as favorites or bookmarks that can be recalled in the future (Local storage is accepted, any serverless way of storing data is also accepted)
- [x] A lot of extra points if you include a few tests.
- [ ] We don't care about the UX design, but a nicely styled app would get extra points :D
We will check for coding style and consistency mostly, we are interested on seeing how you think and organize a project.
